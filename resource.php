<h2>About the digital resource</h2>

<p>This digital edition combines several resources in order to facilitate more efficient study of this collection of glosses:</p>

<ul>

<li>The transcription for all of the glosses was supplied by Rijcklof Hofman, who had already published the first half of the corpus (with an introduction, translations and commentary) in <i>The Sankt Gall Priscian Commentary. Part 1</i> (2 vols, Münster, 1996). </li>

<li>Bernhard Bauer supplied translations and morphological analysis for the Old Irish glosses, based on his <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/priscian/" target="_blank">Database of the Old Irish Priscian Glosses</a> (funded by the Austrian <a target="_blank" href="http://pf.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-finder?search[what]=22859">FWF</a>).</li>

<li>The text of Priscian was made available thanks to the <a href="http://kaali.linguist.jussieu.fr/CGL/index.jsp" target="_blank">Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum</a> project (and Alessandro Garcea in particular). </li>

<li>The resource also provides images of the printed edition (with critical apparatus and apparatus of sources) by Martin Hertz in Heinrich Keil (ed.), <i>Grammatici Latini</i> (6 vols, Leipzig, 1855–80), vols 2–3.</li>

<li>The edition links to manuscript images at the <a href="http://www.cesg.unifr.ch/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Codices Electronici Sangallenses</a> (CESG) Virtual Library.</li>

<li>It also provides images of the edition of Old Irish glosses (with translations and occasional notes) by Whitley Stokes and John Strachan in <i>Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus</i> (2 vols, London, 1901–1910), <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/thesauruspalaeoh02stokuoft" target="_blank">vol. 2</a>, pp. 49–224. </li>

</ul>

<p>The first version of the website was launched in 2010 as part of a postdoctoral research project (2009–2011) funded by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (now <a href="http://www.research.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Research Council</a>).</p>

<p>A revised edition (version 2.0), incorporating Bernhard Bauer's database, was launched first in beta (testing) version in November 2017 and replaced the original version on 13 May 2018.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pmoran.ie" target="_blank">Pádraic Moran</a> was responsible for all aspects of technical production. Please send any corrections or feedback to:

<h3>Work in progress</h3>

<p>As at April 2013:</p>

<ul>
<li>Links to <i>Thesaurus</i> images broken for about 10% (c. 400) of references.</li>
<li>Some category codes diverge from the master schema (these are marked [?] pending resolution).</li>
<li>On a few pages, the glosses do not all appear under the relevant lines of Priscian, but at the bottom of the page instead.</li>
<li>Information on different glossing hands is in the process of being encoded.</li>
<li>The sigla &lt; &gt; represent both text illegible and later additions; these are in the process of being distinguished.</li>
</ul>
