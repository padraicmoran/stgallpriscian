http://www.stgallpriscian.ie/

A resource by: Rijcklof Hofman, Pádraic Moran, Bernhard Bauer 

This digital edition combines several resources in order to facilitate more efficient study of this collection of glosses:

- The transcription for all of the glosses was supplied by Rijcklof Hofman, who had already published the first half of the corpus (with an introduction, translations and commentary) in _The Sankt Gall Priscian Commentary. Part 1_ (2 vols, Münster, 1996). 
- Bernhard Bauer supplied translations and morphological analysis for the Old Irish glosses, based on his 
   Database of the Old Irish Priscian (http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/priscian/) (funded by the Austrian FWF).
- The text of Priscian was made available thanks to the Corpus Grammaticorum Latinorum ()https://htldb.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/cgl/)
 project (and Alessandro Garcea in particular). 
- The resource also provides images of the printed edition (with critical apparatus and apparatus of sources) by 
   Martin Hertz in Heinrich Keil (ed.), _Grammatici Latini_ (6 vols, Leipzig, 1855–80), vols 2–3.</li>
- The edition links to manuscript images at e-Codices—Virtual
   Manuscript Library of Switzerland (http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en).
- It also provides images of the edition of Old Irish glosses (with translations and occasional notes) by Whitley 
   Stokes and John Strachan in _Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus_ (2 vols, London, 1901–1910), vol. 2, pp. 49–224 (http://www.archive.org/details/thesauruspalaeoh02stokuoft).
