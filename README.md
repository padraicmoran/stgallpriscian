Database content can be found in the file db_priscian_v2.sql. For security, the file includes/connection.php (containing the MySQL database user name and password) has been excluded from the repository. If creating a new version of this website, rename includes/connection_EXAMPLE.php as includes/connection.php and supply the appropriate database authentication details.
